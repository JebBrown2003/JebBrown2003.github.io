## About

I’m a data enthusiast who enjoys building things with data especially when the inputs are messy, the questions aren’t obvious, and the system has to work end-to-end.

I like building and maintaining data pipelines, but the goal is always understanding: using data, models, and tools to answer real questions and make better decisions.

## What I'm Interest In

I’m interested in applying data to real-world systems.

That includes both what I study and how I work.

On the domain side, I’m drawn to areas like sports, economics, politics, and finance—systems shaped by incentives, uncertainty, and imperfect information.

On the technical side, I enjoy:
- Building data pipelines from imperfect inputs
- Exploring data to uncover patterns and inconsistencies
- Modeling systems to test assumptions
- Using data-backed reasoning to answer difficult questions

## What You’ll Find Here

This site is organized around projects.

Each post typically walks through a specific piece of a larger system—how something was designed, built, or reasoned about—often supported by diagrams, visuals, and concrete examples.

Topics commonly include:
- Data pipelines and system design
- Exploratory data analysis
- Modeling and simulation
- Interpreting results and uncertainty
- LLM-based systems and applied AI

Posts are intended to be complete and polished, even if the ideas themselves evolve over time. The goal is clarity and usefulness, not academic rigor.

## Why This Exists

This site exists to document work that’s worth finishing.

I use it to:
- Break projects into understandable pieces
- Explain how and why certain design choices were made
- Capture what worked, what didn’t, and what I’d change next time

If something here helps you understand a system more clearly—or gives you an idea worth stealing—that’s a bonus.
